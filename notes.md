# Routing
## DocumentsIDPage
Id Pages require async params that need to be awaited before use in Nextjs 15

## DocumentsLayout
If we dont pass children, all the /documents paths including /documents/123 etc will display the layout page file
<br>
Also, the layout doesnt re-render

### Self Notes
use ctrl+shift+p and developer:reload window 
<br>
.next folder can be deleted anytime
